# Spotify Analysis

## Project Description

`spotify_analysis` is a simple EDA project using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn to load, clean and explore the 2020 Top 50 global Spotify tracks. The aim of this project is to examine audio characteristics such as danceability, energy and loudness to identify the features that underpin a successful hit.
